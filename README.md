## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- MySQL 8.0
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/PokePocketData.git
cd PokePocketData
```

2. **Configure Google OAuth**
- Create a project in Google Cloud Console
- Enable Google OAuth API
- Set up OAuth consent screen
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Note your Client ID and Secret

3. **Configure Environment**
Create `.env` in the backend/app/database directory:
```plaintext
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=pokepocketdata
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

4. **Database Setup**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pokepocketdata;
CREATE USER 'ppdd_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pokepocketdata.* TO 'ppdd_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

5. **Backend Installation**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.database.base
```

6. **Frontend Installation**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

**Start Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Start Frontend Development Server**
```bash
cd frontend
ng serve
```
