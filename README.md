- MySQL Workbench
- Additional development tools will be listed as needed

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 
- npm
- Angular CLI
- Python 3.8+ 
- pip
- Git
- MySQL Server 8.0
- MySQL Workbench

## Database Setup

### MySQL Installation and Configuration
1. Install MySQL Server 8.0 and MySQL Workbench
2. Create a new connection in MySQL Workbench:
   - Connection Name: PokePocketData_Local
   - Hostname: localhost
   - Port: 3306
   - Username: ppdd_api_user (create this user for API connections)

3. Set up the API user with appropriate permissions:
```sql
CREATE USER 'ppdd_api_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pokepocketdata.* TO 'ppdd_api_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Environment Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```plaintext
DB_USER=ppdd_api_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=pokepocketdata
```

Note: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. A `.env.example` template is provided for reference.

## Installation

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/PokePocketData.git
cd PokePocketData
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Backend Setup
```bash
cd ../backend
# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Initialization
```bash
# Initialize the database and create tables
python -m app.database.base

# Initialize Alembic for migrations
alembic init migrations

# Create initial migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head
```

### 5. Start the Application
```bash
# Start the backend server (from backend directory)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start the frontend development server (from frontend directory)
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Implementation
The project implements a comprehensive API with:
1. SQLAlchemy Models (`app/database/models.py`):
   - Define database table structures and relationships
   - Implement database constraints and validations
   - Manage database operations

2. Pydantic Models (`app/models/ppdd_models.py`):
   - Handle data validation
   - Implement business logic constraints
   - Define type-safe data structures

3. API Schemas (`app/models/schemas.py`):
   - Define request/response models
   - Handle data serialization/deserialization
   - Implement API-specific validations

4. API Endpoints (`app/routers/ppdd_router.py`):
   - Implement CRUD operations for all resources
   - Handle data validation and transformation
   - Implement proper error handling

## API Features
- Full CRUD operations for cards, decks, and game records
- Advanced filtering and pagination
- Proper error handling and validation
- Type-safe request/response handling
- Transaction management
- Health check endpoint

## Development Status
ðŸš§ The project is currently in active development with the following completed:
- Basic project structure
- Database models defined (both SQLAlchemy and Pydantic)
- Database connection configuration
- Migration system setup with Alembic
- Initial API user setup
- API router implementation
- Request/response schemas defined

## Local Development Notes
- This project is designed for local development and learning purposes
- Database connections are configured for localhost only
- Environment variables should be set up locally using the provided `.env.example` template
- API user (ppdd_api_user) is configured with local-only permissions
- Database migrations are handled through Alembic

## Contributing
As this is a personal development project, contributions are currently not being accepted. Feel free to fork the repository for your own learning purposes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Database Connection Errors:
   - Verify MySQL service is running
   - Check credentials in `.env` file
   - Ensure ppdd_api_user has proper permissions

2. Migration Issues:
   - Clear any existing migrations: `alembic downgrade base`
   - Remove migration versions directory
   - Reinitialize: `alembic init migrations`
   - Create new migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate`

3. API Issues:
   - Check FastAPI logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify request payload matches schema definitions
   - Ensure database connection is active
